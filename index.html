                    <p>learning these skills is much like learning another language, which is i guess why they're referred to as "programming languages". i stare at my computer and try to piece together the different pieces of syntax. "syntax"! what an alien word. all of this text vomit is completely foreign to me. well, it doesn't matter a whole much. at the end of the day, i look at the mess i made and wonder if i'm maybe not as cut out for this as i thought before.</p>
